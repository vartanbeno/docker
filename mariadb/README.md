# MariaDB

Extremely similar to containerizing a MySQL database, since MariaDB is pretty much an open-source fork of it. The only things that I changed are the image/service names.

See [here](../mysql) for more info, or [Docker's official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/mariadb/).
